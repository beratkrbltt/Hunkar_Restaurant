# Hunkar_Restaurant
This is a practice project where I created a simple and responsive restaurant website using HTML and CSS. The website showcases a restaurantâ€™s menu, services, and contact information. The main goal of this project was to improve my front-end development skills and practice layout, design, and responsiveness.
