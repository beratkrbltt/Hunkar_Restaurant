**Responsive Hünkar Restaurant Website – A Personal Coding Project** ✨

---

## 🚀 **Overview**
I recreated the Hünkar Restaurant website as a **fun and educational project**. I truly enjoy visiting Hünkar Restaurant, so I decided to **code their website myself** to practice modern web design techniques.  

The project showcases a **clean and responsive layout** using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with features like **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, **z-index**, and **positioning** to create precise and visually appealing sections. The website adapts perfectly to both desktop and mobile screens.
